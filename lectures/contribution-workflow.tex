	\frametitle{Contributing to pyMOR in 10 steps}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Fork the pyMOR repository.
		\item Checkout a new branch in your fork.
		\item Create a virtual environment (\mintinline{shell}{python3 -m virtualenv venv}).
		\item Install pyMOR in editable mode (\mintinline{shell}{pip install -e .[full]}).
		\item ***Add your code here (now)***
		\item Add tests for your code (maybe also a demo or even a tutorial) and run the tests locally (\mintinline{shell}{make docker_test} or \mintinline{shell}{make test}).
		\item Open a pull request on GitHub.
		\item Add a label (pr:change, pr:deprecation, pr:fix, pr:new-feature, pr:removal).
		\item Ask for reviews.
		\item Make sure that the CI pipeline passes (see next slide).

	\frametitle{Some of the components of pyMOR's CI pipeline}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Linter checks.
		\item Checks for autosquashing of commits, PR labels, and merge conflicts.
		\item Tests in \mintinline{shell}{src/pymortests/} and demos in \mintinline{shell}{src/pymordemos/} are executed in several different settings.
		\item Tutorials in \mintinline{shell}{docs/source/} are used as additional tests.
		\item Documentation (available for inspection under \href{https://docs.pymor.org/list.html}{https://docs.pymor.org/list.html}) and wheels are built.
		\item Installation from different sources (wheels, from source, docker) is performed.

	\frametitle{Important things to remember when contributing}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Format your code according to \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}{PEP8} (\href{https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/}{flake8} and \href{https://pre-commit.com/}{pre-commit} hooks can help you).
		\item Document your code properly (to keep the good quality of our \href{https://docs.pymor.org/latest/autoapi/index.html}{API Reference}).
		\item Write useful commit messages, give keywords if possible, for instance \mintinline{text}{[parameters] fix Mu.to_numpy for empty Mu}
		\item Provide a meaningful description for your pull request.
		\item Make sure that all tests pass (otherwise your pull request cannot be merged).
